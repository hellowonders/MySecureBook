<h2 style="text-align: center;">MySecureBook Help</h2>
<p>MySecureBook is a advance blockchain based documents storage solution which uses AES-128 bit encryption standard. We have used a newly invented concept '<em>Progressive Blockchain</em>' in this software to prevent data loss due to invalidation of traditional blockchain when a block has been deleted/corrupted.</p>
<p>Any data saved cannot be modified by any means to maintain authenticity and reliability. If such tempering/hacking is being tried, the project will get invalidated and cannot be used further. However, previously stored data can be recovered.</p>
<p><strong>Some Use Cases</strong></p>
<p>1. User can store health receipts in a sequential manner over a period of time, the project can be shared to a doctor having full patient diagnosis history, it prevents need to carry physical prescriptions.</p>
<p>2. Business meeting notes can be saved using a timestamp to keep track of the whole project. Documents such as BRD, SOW etc. can be saved by versions.</p>
<p>3. Confidential personal information can be stored securely, AES-128 encryption is used by default.</p>
<p>4. Educational certificates can be maintained, they can be shared securely to a hiring company.</p>
<p>5. Keep track of expenses and bills by uploading invoices.</p>
